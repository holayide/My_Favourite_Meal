                <h3>History and Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    Jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. 
                    The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, 
                    onions, spices, vegetables and meat in 
                    a single pot, although its ingredients 
                    and preparation methods vary across different regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian 
                    region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, 
                    spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown. 
                    The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne, containing 
                    rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.

                <h3>What is Jollof Rice</h3>
                <p>
                    Jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. 
                    Many would argue it first originated from Senegal, 
                    but others swear it's from Nigeria. No matter the origin, jolof is one dish that 
                    binds us all across Africa and it's swiftly gaining 
                    international recognition and popularity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nigerian Jollof is a stewed base rice dish made with three main ingredients 
                    such as rice, tomato/pepper- 
                    stew base, and African-style seasonings like 
                    curry powder, dried thyme, and chicken stock cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only is this easy rice dish a party favorite in its native land, 
                    but it is also globally recognized - 
                    ask my American and European friends who have 
                    begged me to make this on countless occasions!

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide the onion into 3 portions. Chop one portion, slice the other portion very thin and cut the rest into wedges. Also, cut 3 of the Roma tomatoes into wedges and slice the remainder thinly for later use. </li>
                    <li>Place the red bell pepper, wedged onion and tomato, scotch bonnet, ginger, and garlic in a blender. Process until it's roughly chopped.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, place a heavy bottom saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil, heat up a bit, add the chopped portion of the onion and bay leaves. Allow cooking for 2 minutes. As soon as the onion and bay leave become aromatic, add the tomato paste, and fry for about 2 minutes. Add the pureed mix, cover, and bring to a boil for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In the meantime, rinse the rice thoroughly under running water until the water turns clear. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add seasoning cube, salt, curry powder, thyme, and liquid smoke to the sauce. Stir to combine. Add 3 cups of stock and stir in a circular motion once. Add the rice, stir ONCE in a steady stream. Cover the pot with aluminum foil and then with the lid. Lower heat to medium-low and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Check for doneness and adjust the taste. Add basil, the thinly sliced onion, a teaspoon of liquid smoke, and tomato.</li>
                    <li>Stir completely and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Add the butter, and fluff with a fork.</li>
